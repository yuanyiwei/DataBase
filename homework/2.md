# HW02

## 查询姓名中含有“科”字的学生学号和姓名

```sql
select sno, sname from Student where sname like '%科%';
```

## 查询学分不低于 3 分的必修课课程号和课程名

```sql
select cno, cname from Course where type = 0 and credit >= 3;
```

## 查询选修了公选课但是缺少成绩的学生学号和姓名

```sql
select Student.sno, sname from SC join Course on SC.cno = Course.cno
join Student on SC.sno = Student.sno where type = 3 and score is null;
```

不用 `join`：

```sql
select distinct Student.sno, Student.sname from Student, Course, SC
where Student.sno = SC.sno and Course.cno = SC.cno and type = 3 and score is null;
```

## 查询年龄大于 20 的学生学号、姓名和年龄

```sql
select sno, sname, TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, birthdate, now()) from Student
where date_sub(now(), interval 20 year) > birthdate;
```

## 查询已选必修课总学分大于 16 并且所选通识课成绩都大于 75 分的学生姓名

```sql
select sname from Student
where sno in (select distinct SC.sno from Course, SC
inner join (select sno from Course, SC
where Course.cno = SC.cno and type = 2 group by sno having MIN(score) > 75)
as snop using(sno)
where Course.cno = SC.cno and type = 0 group by sno having SUM(credit) > 16);
```

## 查询已经修完所有必修课且成绩合格的学生学号和姓名

```sql
select sno, sname from Student
where not exists
(select sno, sname from Course where cno not in
    (select cno from SCwhere SC.sno = Student.sno and score >= 60) and type = 0);
```

## 查询总平均成绩排名在前 50%（向上取整）的学生中必修课平均分最高的前 10 位同学，要求返回这些学生的学号、姓名、必修课平均分以及课程总平均成绩（不足 10 位时则全部返回）

```sql
create view Average (sno, sname, total_avg) as
(select Student.sno, Student.sname, AVG(SC.score) from Student, SC, Course
where Student.sno = SC.sno and Course.cno = SC.cno
group by Student.sno);

create view Rank50 (sno, sname, total_avg, total_rank)
as (select sno, sname, total_avg, PERCENT_RANK() over w as 'percent_rank' from Average
window w as (order by total_avg desc));

create view Top10 (sno, sname, class0_avg) as
(select Student.sno, Student.sname, AVG(SC.score) from Student, SC, Course
where Student.sno = SC.sno and Course.type = 0
group by Student.sno
limit 10);

select Top10.sno, Top10.sname, Top10.class0_avg, Rank50.total_avg from Rank50, Top10
where Rank50.sno = Top10.sno and Rank50.sname = Top10.sname and Rank50.total_rank <= 0.5;

drop view Average;
drop view Rank50;
drop view Top10;
```

## 查询每门课程的课程名、课程类型、最高成绩、最低成绩、平均成绩和不及格率，要求结果按通识课、必修课、选修课、公选课顺序排列（提示：课程名可能有重名）

```sql
create view Cnt (cno, count) as
(select cno, count(sno)
from SC group by cno);

create view Fail (cno, failpass) as
(select cno, count(sno)
from SC where score >= 60 group by cno);

select cname, type, MAX(score) as max_score, MIN(score) as min_score,
    AVG(score) as avg_score, 1 - Fail.failpass/Cnt.count as fail_rate
from Course, SC, Cnt, Fail
where Course.cno = SC.cno and SC.cno = Cnt.cno and Fail.cno = SC.cno
group by Course.cno, Course.cname
order by field(type, 2, 0, 1, 3);

drop view Cnt;
drop view Fail;
```

## 查询存在课程重修不及格情况的学生学号、姓名以及重修不及格的课程号和课程名

```sql
select SC.sno, sname, SC.cno, cname from Student, Course, SC
where Student.sno = SC.sno and Course.cno = SC.cno and SC.score < 60
group by SC.sno, sname, SC.cno, cname having count(*)>1;
```

## SC 表中重复的 sno 和 cno 意味着该学生重修了课程（在不同的学期里），现在我们希望删除学生重复选课的信息，只保留最近一个学期的选课记录以及成绩，请给出相应的 SQL 语句

```sql
create view a as (
    select distinct sc1.sno, sc1.cno, SC.term from SC sc1
    left outer join SC on SC.sno = sc1.sno and SC.cno = sc1.cno and SC.term < sc1.term
    where SC.sno is not null
);
delete from SC where exists (
    select * from a where a.sno = SC.sno and a.cno = SC.cno and a.term = SC.term
);
drop view a;
```
